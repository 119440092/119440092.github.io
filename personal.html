<h1><p> ISAAC PEARSON<p><h1>

<h2><p> Date of Birth: 24/07/2000<p>
<p>
 My name is Isaac Pearson, I am a First Year Student In UCC. I have just returned from a gap year of working and travelling in Canada and I am in search of part time work. My availability is as follows:<p>

Monday- Friday: Afternoon<p>
Saturday-Sunday: All day<p>

I am a hardworking, driven and self-motivated person as you can see from my Leaving Cert score and my decision to go on a solo gap year. 
I work well on my own and I also thrive in the company of others. I pride myself in being a quick learner with impeccable attention to detail. I believe I would be a great addition to your team and I look forward to hearing from you.
